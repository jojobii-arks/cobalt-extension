# cobalt-extension

- A chrome extension for [@wukko/cobalt](https://github.com/wukko/cobalt)
- Vite + React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS
- Meant as a proof of concept. Will elaborate on eventually.

# Note

- Feel free to use the one I host at [co.arks.cafe](https://co.arks.cafe) (API URL: [api.co.arks.cafe](https://api.co.arks.cafe)) when using this extension.
- Preferrably use host a Cobalt instance locally when testing.
